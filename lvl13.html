    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript (JS)[a] is a programming language and core technology of the
         Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
         It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.[6]
         Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
          behavior.[10]

Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes
 the client code.
 These engines are also utilized
 in some servers and a variety of apps.
 The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.[11]

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled
 language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[12] It has dynamic typing,
  prototype-based object-orientation
 , and first-class functions.
  It is multi-paradigm,
  supporting event-driven,
 
 functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
  (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and
   the Document
  Object Model (DOM).</p>
