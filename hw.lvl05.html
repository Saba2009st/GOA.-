        Honor was founded in 2013 as a Huawei sub-brand.[2] Honor's line of smartphones allowed Huawei to compete with mid-range online smartphone brands in China and globally.[3][4][5] Honor primarily sells products online, but some Honor products are also available at stores in selected markets.[6][7]

        On 15 May 2019, the US government imposed a ban on Huawei and its subsidiary Honor. This prevented the use of apps such as the Play Store, Google Maps and Gmail on Honor smartphones.[8]

        In order to establish independence from Huawei and thus "ensure" Honor's continued existence, the brand and the associated business areas were sold to the company Shenzhen Zhixin New Information Technology Co., Ltd.,[1][9] a newly founded conglomerate of 30 Chinese companies, some of which have close ties to the government.[10][11] The founder and main shareholder of the conglomerate is Shenzhen Smart City Technology Development Group Co, a state-controlled company owned by the Shenzhen City Government.[1][11][12] On 17 November 2020, Huawei announced that it had sold Honor entirely.[13]
        Timeline of international expansion

        Honor began to offer its products internationally in 2014,[2] launching the Honor 3C in April in Malaysia,[14] followed by the Honor 6 in Europe in October.[15] By June 2015, the brand was available in 74 countries.[5] In October that year, announced to increase revenue to $5 billion with plans to focus on India.[16][17]

        In 2015, Honor's Vmall online store, previously available only in China, launched in Europe and the United Kingdom, enabling direct purchases from the manufacturer.[18][19][20]

        Honor made its debut in the United States with the release of the Huawei Honor 5X at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2016.[21][6] Initially available for online purchase only, the Huawei Honor 5X was later made available at select brick and mortar stores.[21] Also this year Honor started to sell the first fitness-trackers.[2]

        In August 2016, Recode reported that Honor had sold over 60 million products, generating over $8.4 billion in revenue.[22]

        In January 2017 at CES, Honor announced that the Honor 6X, previously available only in China, would be available in thirteen new markets, including the United States.[23][24] The phone earned "best of CES 2017" accolades from several technology publications, including Android Authority,[25][26] Digital Trends,[27] Slash Gear,[28] and Talk Android.[29]

        In 2018 Honor started to sell laptops and smartwatches, in 2019 earbuds and TVs.[2]

        Since the US sanctions and the brand sale to Shenzhen Zhixin New Information Technology in 2020 Honor has maintained its presence in the Indian market and launched laptops and wearables through e-commerce platforms.[30] The first non-Huawei phone, the V40, was released in January 2021[31] and with the Honor 50 release in December 2021 they provided the first smartphone that supported Google Play Services again.[32] Globally, the brand has decided to focus aggressively on the foldable smartphone, with the intent to provide high-end foldables at affordable prices.[30]

                Honor's main smartphone series progresses numerically in increments of 10 over the generations. The current device (as of June 2025) is the 400. Sometimes, "Lite" and "Pro" sibling models are also released.[2]

                Honor's second line of smartphones has different names depending on where they are marketed. In China, this line is known as the V series, while internationally, the phones are marketed under the name "View." For example, while the Honor V30 was released in China, it was known as the Honor View 30 elsewhere. This series is typically used to test features that eventually make their way into the flagship line.[2]

                Another key series in Honor's smartphone lineup is the X series, a budget-friendly series with large screens and long-lasting batteries. The latest generations of X phones featured popup cameras and were sometimes available in Pro and Lite variants.[2]

                Finally, Honor has revived its Magic line with the premium devices Honor Magic 3 and the foldable Magic V. It appears that Honor will use this model designation more frequently in the future.[2] In 2023, Honor brought its first foldable smartphone, the Honor Magic VS, to the European market.

                In addition to the main series mentioned above, Honor also has less widely known series at generally lower prices, such as the S, A, I, and C series, which also follow the generation numbering scheme.[2]
